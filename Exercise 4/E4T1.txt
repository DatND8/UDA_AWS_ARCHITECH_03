Changes to Prevent SSH Brute Force Attacks
Block SSH Access: Disable SSH connections to the EC2 instances if they are not required for operational purposes.

Move EC2 Instances to a Private Subnet: Place the EC2 instances in a private subnet and configure them to allow connections solely from load balancers, eliminating direct internet exposure.

Limit Open Ports on EC2: Restrict the number of open ports on the EC2 instances, ensuring that only necessary ports for application functionality are accessible.

Preventing Access to Sensitive Data
To safeguard against unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as the "secret recipes" bucket, consider the following measures:

Restrict Access to Sensitive Data: Ensure that sensitive data is not accessible from any instance that does not require it, implementing the principle of least privilege.

Encrypt Sensitive Data: Use encryption to protect data at rest and in transit, making it unreadable to unauthorized users.

Configure Resource Policies: Set up stringent resource policies that restrict access to the data, ensuring that only authorized entities can access sensitive information.
