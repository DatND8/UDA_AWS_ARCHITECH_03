Poor Practice 1
To minimize exposure to potential risks, Web Service Instances should be deployed in a secure manner. They should not be placed in a public subnet where they are directly accessible from the internet. Instead, public traffic should be managed by the load balancer, which acts as a bridge between the internet and the internal network. For enhanced security, Web Service Instances should be housed in a private subnet, ensuring that access is only possible through the load balancer. This configuration prevents direct exposure to external traffic and reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access or attacks. The security group linked to the Web Service Instances should be configured to accept traffic only from the security group of the load balancer. This ensures secure and controlled communication between the load balancer and the Web Service Instances, allowing only legitimate traffic. By using this setup, Web Service Instances benefit from an additional security layer, where the load balancer handles public trafic, keeping internal resources protected within a private subnet.

Poor Practice 2
To enhance security, Amazon S3 should adopt a resource policy that limits access exclusively to Web Service Instances, ensuring traffic stays within the AWS network. Implementing Amazon S3 VPC endpoints can further enforce that only specific buckets are reachable within the VPC.
